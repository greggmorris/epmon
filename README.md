This project is an implementation of the task described in the EndpointAgentInterviewProject11.2021.pdf file,
implemented for Ubuntu Linux. It may work on other Linux flavors as well but has not been tested elsewhere.
I used the CLion IDE from JetBrains which uses CMake for the build process.

The project makes use of [Neils Lohmann's JSON library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), the
procps library (required installing libprocps-dev), the [curl library](https://curl.se/libcurl/), and the pthread library.
